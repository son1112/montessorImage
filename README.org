     - [ ] Montessori quote/s

       'We must help the child to act for himself, will for himself, think for 
        himself; this is the art of those who aspire to serve the spirit.'
        (Education for a New World, p. 69)

       'The child's development follows a path of successive stages of 
        independence, and our knowledge of this must guide us in our behaviour 
        towards him. We have to help the child to act, will and think for 
        himself. This is the art of serving the spirit, an art which can be 
        practised to perfection only when working among children.' 
        (The Absorbent Mind, p. 257)

       'Independence is not a static condition; it is a continuous conquest, and 
        in order to reach not only freedom, but also strength, and the 
        perfection on one's powers, it is necessary to follow this path of 
        unremitting toil.' 
        (The Abosrbent Mind, Chapter 8, p. 91)

       'The child seeks for independence by means of work; an independence of 
        body and mind.' 
        (The Abosrbent Mind, Chapter 8, p. 91)

       'We must clearly understand that when we give the child freedom and 
        independence, we are giving freedom to a worker already braced for 
        action, who cannot live without working and being active.' 
        (The Abosrbent Mind, Chapter 8, p. 91)

       'Except when he has regressive tendencies, the child's nature is to aim 
        directly and energetically at functional independence.' 
        (The Absorbent Mind)

       'The child can only develop fully by means of experience in his 
        environment. We call such experience "work".' 
        (The Absorbent Mind)
